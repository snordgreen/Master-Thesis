\section*{Acknowledgments}

First, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to my supervisor Tor Nordam who provided me with this interesting problem, as well as competent and enthusiastic guidance throughout the project. Also of great importance has been the collaboration, discussion, and help I have received from fellow student Arne Magnus Tveita LÃ¸ken. Your contributions have been invaluable. Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family who continue to support me in everything I do.
